 Alzheimer’s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative condition that pri
marily affects elderly individuals, leading to progressive deterioration in
 memory, thinking, and behavioral abilities. As the global population ages,
 the prevalence of Alzheimer’s is increasing at an alarming rate, posing sig
nificant challenges to healthcare systems and patient caregivers. Accurate
 and early-stage diagnosis is crucial for managing the disease effectively and
 improving the quality of life for patients. Traditional diagnostic methods,
 which often rely on clinical assessments and manual analysis of MRI scans,
 can be time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone.
 In this study, we explore a deep learning-based approach to automate the
 classification of Alzheimer’s disease stages using magnetic resonance imag
ing (MRI). We employ transfer learning models—ResNet50, VGG19, and
 InceptionV3—due to their strong performance in image recognition tasks.
 The models are fine-tuned on a dataset containing MRI images categorized
 into four classes: NonDemented, VeryMildDemented, MildDemented, and
 ModerateDemented. Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques are
 applied to enhance the model’s ability to generalize across unseen data. The
 models are evaluated based on accuracy, loss, and AUC metrics, and the
 results are visualized using training curves and confusion matrices.
 Among the models implemented, ResNet50 demonstrated the highest
 classification performance with balanced generalization across all categories.
 This research highlights the potential of leveraging state-of-the-art deep
 learning techniques to support early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s
 disease. Such systems can assist medical professionals in making informed
 decisions and pave the way for AI-assisted clinical applications in neurology
 and radiology
